Yesterday Apple announced the [Apple Pencil](http://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/) among the new [iPad Pro](http://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/), and [iPhones](http://www.apple.com/iphone-6s/). This small pencil has caused much controversy ( [Apple's Pencil looks great but...](http://www.engadget.com/2015/09/10/apple-ipad-pro-pencil-designer-reaction/), ['Over my dead body:' The Pencil and four other things Steve Jobs would hate](http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/10/technology/apple-pencil-steve-jobs-stylus/) ), though I believe it has a place in the Apple lineup. 

I would not declare myself as an Apple fan boy, but I do enjoy their products and have many of there products. 

The following quote has been thrown around on many sites

>Q: How do you close applications when multitasking? 
>A: (Scott Forstall) You don't have to. The user just uses things and doesn't ever have to worry about it. 
>A: (Steve Jobs) It's like we said on the iPad, if you see a stylus, they blew it. In multitasking, if you see a task manager... they blew it. Users shouldn't ever have to think about it.

I believe Steve Job's answer "if you see a stylus, they blew it" is referring to the everyday use of the device. If your tablet requires a stylus to operate day to day tasks there is a barrier created between it and the user. However if your tablet works with just the hand, like the iPad does, the interaction with the device is natural. I do not think Steve Jobs would be apposed to the Apple Pencil, simply because it is not designed for day to day use, but for a specific purpose, to give professional artists a tool where they can create. Asking artist to draw and paint with there fingers is like asking a programmer to [code with voice recognition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzJ0CytAsec), it works but is an inefficient and painstaking process.
