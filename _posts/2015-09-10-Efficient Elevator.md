I think it is wasteful for an elevator to stop at consecutive floors. I know that I am more than willing to walk up or down at least one flight of stairs, and I believe that others are too. I think the annoyance of a busy elevator could be drastically reduced if it did not stop and consecutive floors and instead assumed people were willing to walk up or down at least a flight of stairs to get to their floor. This wouldn't require much change for current elevators. Given the set of floors that are selected, try and minimize stops by removing consecutive floors. A sign posted on the doors would act as a way of informing people that the elevator does not stop at consecutive floors. 

If a passenger needs to stop at a floor, because they are unable to walk up stairs, they can simply pres and hold the button and that floor will be stopped at no matter what.

There are potential issues with this idea:
1. People do not understand this elevator is different and are confused when the elevator dose not stop at the floor they requested.
2. People abuse the system for forcing a floor and the elevator loses any possible gains by stopping at all floors. 
3. The complexity of interfacing with the elevator outweighs any efficiently gains, or people simply do not care about the minute they would gain.
