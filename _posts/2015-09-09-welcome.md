This is my site, there are many like it, but this one is mine. It will mostly be dedicated to various side projects and blog posts. 

##A quick little about me:

* I’ve been programing for 6+ years
* I speak Java, Python, C, and a little Ruby, Javascript & Haskell.
* I know OSX, Linux, and Windows, but who doesn’t these days?
* I am currently looking for work in the Bay Area.


##Check out some of my side projects:

* [HN-Jobs](/HN-Jobs/) - a tool to help filter HN Who is hiriing thread
* [GhCM](https://github.com/RyanEager/GhCM) - a small ultility used to write a message in your contributions graph
