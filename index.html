<h3>Hello,</h3>
<p>This is my site, there are many like it, but this one is mine. It will mostly be dedicated to various side projects and blog posts. </p>

<h2>A quick little about me:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I’ve been programing for 6+ years</li>
  <li>I speak Java, Python, C, Ruby and a little Haskell.</li>
  <li>I know OSX, Linux, and Windows, but who doesn’t these days?</li>
  <li>I am currently looking for work in the Bay Area.</li>
</ul>
