###Hello,
This is my site, there are many like it, but this one is mine. It will be mostly dedicated to various side projects, and blog posts, when I get around to writing them. 

## A quick little about me:

 * I've been programing for 6+ years
 * I speak Java, Python, C, Ruby and a little Haskell,

   and I'm always ready to learn new languages. 

 * I know OSX, Linux, and Windows, but who doesn't these days?
 * I am currently looking for work in the Bay Area.
