###Hello,
This is my site, there are many like it, but this one is mine. It will mostly be dedicated to various side projects and blog posts. 

## A quick little about me:

 * I've been programing for 6+ years
 * I speak Java, Python, C, Ruby and a little Haskell.
 * I know OSX, Linux, and Windows, but who doesn't these days?
 * I am currently looking for work in the Bay Area.
